In this project, I dived into analyzing customer transactions and uncovering insights using SQL queries on a cleaned banking dataset. I will explore customer behavior, transaction patterns, and their impact across different regions.
The problem of analyzing banking trends is crucial because customer transactions generate vast amounts of data, which, if properly analyzed, can reveal important patterns and insights about customer behavior, spending habits, and regional economic activity. Banks and financial institutions rely on understanding these patterns to make informed, data-driven decisions that enhance their service offerings, optimize resources, and mitigate risks.

This analysis enables banking professionals to understand how customers interact with financial services and respond to economic shifts, allowing banks to identify profitable customer segments, personalize services, and manage financial health effectively. Furthermore, by understanding regional transaction patterns, banks can support regional economic growth by identifying underserved areas and tailoring their services to meet local needs, ultimately contributing to a stronger financial ecosystem.
